I work in **statistical genetics**, **clinical trials**, **adaptive designs** and **repeated measurements**. My research interests are in statistical and computational methods for the analysis of gene-based association tests and whole-genome sequencing studies. Particularly, I am interested in interpreting the functions of large number of disease-associated variants in the noncoding genome integrating enhancer-target gene data and the spatial structure for human genomes (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques, e.g., Hi-C data). Besides, I am also interested in repeating the multiple pre-post treatment measurements in randomized clinical trials and adaptive designs for dose-response studies.
