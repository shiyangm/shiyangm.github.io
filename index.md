### ACADEMIC POSITION
 
   - _Postdoctoral Research Scientist (2019-now), Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University_   
       - Supervisor: [Dr. Iuliana Ionita-Laza](http://www.columbia.edu/~ii2135/)  
       
       
### RESEARCH  INTEREST

I work in **statistical genomics**, **clinical trials** and **adaptive designs**. I am particularly interested in developing statistical and computational methods for the analysis of genetic and functional genomics data. I have developed powerful gene-based testing by integrating long-range chromatin interactions (e.g., cell-type specific Hi-C data for human genomes) and knockoff genotype. I am also insterested in adaptive dose-response studies for clinical trials.
